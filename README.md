# Overview
TACG is an R package developed to enable the simulation of tumor SNP array or CGH data. With TACG one can simulate copy
number variation (CNV) affected chromosomes. The main intended use of this package is the testing of genomic copy number 
related analyses on data for which the underlying truth is already known, allowing one to assess the accuracy of methods
being applied. The package also contains functions for the assessment of several copy number segmentation algorithms.
